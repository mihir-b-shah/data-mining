# data-mining

**mmds_files** is a collection of Java implementations for common data mining algorithms.

**benchmarks** is a collection of benchmarks of some techniques I was testing/data structures I built to measure performance for use
                in the **mmds_files** implementations
                
**octave_scripts** are scripts I wrote in Octave to test things when the Java implementations were very difficult (i.e, SVD decomposition)

**python_scripts** are scripts I wrote to test some miscellaneous things.
